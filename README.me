This repository demonstrates how to automate AWS resource inventory using Bash, AWS CLI, and cron jobs on an Amazon Linux EC2 instance.

The project accompanies a detailed Medium article and is designed to be practical, beginner-friendly, and portfolio-ready.

🚀 What This Project Does
The automation script collects and displays information about:
- S3 Buckets
- EC2 Instances (saved to a timestamped report file)
- Lambda Functions
- IAM Users

The script is designed to be cron-safe, using absolute paths and proper error handling.

🛠 Prerequisites
- AWS Account
- Amazon Linux 2023 EC2 Instance
- AWS CLI installed and configured
- IAM role or AWS credentials with read-only permissions
- Bash
- jq
- cron

🔧 Setup Instructions
1. Install AWS CLI (Amazon Linux 2023)
sudo dnf install -y awscli
aws --version

2. Configure AWS Credentials
Option 1: Attach an IAM Role to the EC2 instance (recommended)
Option 2: Configure manually
aws configure
📜 Bash Script Overview
The main script is located at:
scripts/aws_resource_tracker.sh
Key features:
Uses set -euo pipefail for safety
Uses absolute paths (required for cron)
Writes EC2 inventory reports to /var/log/ec2-reports
Formats AWS CLI JSON output using jq
▶️ Make the Script Executable
chmod u+x scripts/aws_resource_tracker.sh
⏰ Automating with Cron
Edit the crontab:
crontab -e
Example cron job (runs every 5 minutes):
*/5 * * * * /root/scripts/aws_resource_tracker.sh >> /tmp/cron.log 2>&1
This ensures:
The script runs unattended
Output and errors are logged for debugging
📂 Output
EC2 inventory reports are generated in:
/var/log/ec2-reports/
ec2_instances_YYYY-MM-DD_HH-MM-SS.txt
Each execution creates a new timestamped file.
